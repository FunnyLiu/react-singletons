When building content for the web, you might need to communicate with elements on a webpage. Or you might want to implement functionality using Web APIs which Unity does not currently expose by default. In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browserâ€™s JavaScript engine. React Unity WebGL provides an easy solution for embedding Unity WebGL builds in your React application, with two-way communication between your React and Unity application with advanced API's.

# Installation

Install using npm. Make sure you download the release matching with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. Check the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/releases) for the corresponding version or [view on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-unity-webgl).

```sh
$ npm install react-singletons
```

# Usage

To get started import the Singleton component from `react-singletons`. Then instead of exporting your component. Wrap it into a Singleton as shown below.

## Typscript

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Singleton } from "react-singletons";

export const Popup = new Singleton<IProps>(
  class extends Component<IProps, IState> {
    public render(): ReactNode {
      return <div>Warning! {this.props.message}</div>;
    }
  }
);
```

```tsx
import { Popup } from "./Popup";

Popup.show();
Popup.show({ message: "Oopsie!" });
Popup.close();
```
